                        Students for the Exploration and Development of Space was
                         founded in 1980 at MIT by Peter Diamandis, Princeton University
                          by Scott Scharfman, and Yale University by Richard Sorkin, and
                           consists of an international group of high school,
                            undergraduate, and graduate students from a diverse range of
                             educational backgrounds who are working to promote space. The
                              permanent National Headquarters for SEDS-USA resides at MIT
                               and that of SEDS-India resides at Vellore Institute of
                                Technology. Though collaboration is frequent, each branch
                                 and chapter is independent and coordinates their own
                                  activities and projects. SEDS-VIT seeks to promote space
                                   education, provide opportunities for students and interact
                                    with professionals in space for guidance and mentoring.
                                     The chapter consists of three branches Core, Outreach and
                                      Projects. SEDS-VIT projects based in VIT, Vellore engages
                                       in several space-related projects and seeks to expand
                                        knowledge in the ever-developing arena of space and
                                         technology. It has a history of winning various accolades
                                          at an international level since its inception in 2014. The
                                           chapterâ€™s objective is to develop an interest and provide
                                            a space for students to engage in space robotics and technology,
                                             for budding engineers and space enthusiasts. Our chapter has
                                              participated in several prestigious competitions including CANSAT, Hyperloop,SUAS
                                               and the European Rover Challenge. Currently the chapter is consisting
                                                of two teams namely, Team Ardra, our Aviation team and Team Vyadh,
                                                 our Rover team. SEDS - Projects also pursues several individual projects
                                                  and research, in several fields of science and technology. Our alumni has
                                                   ended up working in various prestigious institutions of research and devleopment.
